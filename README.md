#Reddit SubTracker

##tl;dr

Pretty self-explanatory program. It tracks the amount of subscribers and 'users here now' on a given subreddit at a given interval. As long as the subreddit isn't set to private, you can do this without even needing a reddit bot created.

##Requirements

* PRAW, the reddit Python API.

##Installation

First you install praw using 

    pip install praw

After that, you just put subTracker.py somewhere on your computer and run it.

##Output

Output looks like this:

[08:54:28] 122

[09:04:28] 118

[09:14:28] 148
